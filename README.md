# info ark.io : homeless but not roamless #

This application is meant for high-traffic Metropolitan areas to better organize their influx of stray and surrendered animals given up for adoption.  With the intentionally minimalistic design, users can log in only the essentials needed to better increase likelihood of a successful adoption with decreased likelihood of recidivism.

**Planning Story:**
I had to tackle this project over multiple days.  Before all else, I started by setting up my backend API side and testing it with curl scripts in the Terminal to ensure that everything was running successfully.  Once I did that, I began to format the rough skeleton for the frontend portion by laying out the forms on one day and then tackling their network connectivity afterwards.

**User Stories:**
1. As an employee of an animal shelter user, I want to be able to log
the pivotal bio information on each animal to increase the speed and success
rate of potential adoptions.
2. As a potential adopter, I want to be able to see all the stats on each animal
in an easy to navigate UI so that I can make the best fit to reduce recidivism.
3. As a veterinarian, I want to be able to see the health information and history
of each animal so that I can treat them effectively.

**Technologies Used:**
- jQuery & Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Ajax

**Unsolved Problems:** Still need to figure out how to successfully delete a resource (animal) and would like to eventually have improved CSS.
